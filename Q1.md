### Linear Time - O(n)

An algorithm runs in linear time if its running time grows directly proportional to the size of the input. This means that as the input size (`n`) increases, the running time increases in a linear manner.

##Example:

``java

public int sumArray(int[] arr) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];  // Each element is accessed once
    }
    return sum;
}

### Constant Time - O(1)

An algorithm is said to run in constant time if its performance is independent of the size of the input. In other words, no matter how large the input becomes, the running time remains the same.

Example:

``java

public int getFirstElement(int[] arr) {
    return arr[0];  // Accessing the first element takes constant time
}
### Quadratic Time - O(nÂ²)

An algorithm runs in quadratic time if its running time is proportional to the square of the input size. This typically happens in algorithms that involve nested loops, where for each element of the input, the algorithm performs additional operations for every other element.

#### Example:

```java
public void printPairs(int[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
            System.out.println(arr[i] + " " + arr[j]);
        }
    }
}
