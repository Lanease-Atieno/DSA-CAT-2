1. **O(1) - Constant Time Complexity**  
   An algorithm with O(1) complexity takes a constant amount of time, regardless of the size of the input.

   **Example (Java):**
   ```java
   public int getFirstElement(int[] arr) {
       return arr[0]; // Constant time operation
   }
2.## O(n) - Linear Time Complexity

Linear time complexity, represented as O(n), means that the running time of an algorithm increases proportionally with the size of the input. In other words, as the input size grows, the time required to execute the algorithm grows linearly.

In an algorithm with O(n) time complexity, each element of the input is processed once. This is often the case with algorithms that have a single loop that iterates through all the input data.

### Example (Java):

Consider the following Java method that prints each element of an array:

```java
public void printArrayElements(int[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        System.out.println(arr[i]); // Linear time operation
    }
}
3.## O(n²) - Quadratic Time Complexity

Quadratic time complexity, represented as O(n²), means that the running time of an algorithm increases proportionally to the square of the size of the input. This typically happens in algorithms that involve nested loops where each loop iterates through all elements of the input.

In an O(n²) algorithm, if you have an input of size `n`, the algorithm performs `n * n` operations (hence the "squared" relationship). This leads to slower performance as the input size increases, especially for large datasets.

### Example (Java):

Consider the following Java implementation of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm:

```java
public void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {          // Outer loop
        for (int j = 0; j < arr.length - i - 1; j++) { // Inner loop
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {  
                // Swap elements
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
